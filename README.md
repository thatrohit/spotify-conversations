# Spotify Conversations

## My problem statement

Me and a couple of my friends use Spotify almost everyday. We share similar taste in music and we've got a collaborative playlist to which all of us add songs for others to listen.
Often times we'd want to give share our thoughts on songs other users added. As spotify does not allow commenting on playlist items, we have message others on what we thought of the song.

Messaging on other platform isn't very intutive. It'd have been great if spotify allowed people to comment their feedback on songs. 

## My solution

This is where I thought of the idea to create an app which would get the logged in user's collaborative playlists and allow commenting on them. Playlists would be fetched from Spotify and
comments would be saved on firebase. Application would be on flutter for easy porting. Hosting is on github pages.
We can add the app's github pages url to the playlist description in spotify for easy navigation.
